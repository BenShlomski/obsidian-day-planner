## How to use it

### Showing events from your daily notes

1. **Either the core 'Daily Notes' or the 'Periodic Notes' plugins should be enabled**
1. **The Dataview plugin should be enabled**
1. Open timeline view the following command: `Show the day planner timeline`

Everything Dataview recognizes as a task is shown in the timeline, including:

- Tasks inside callouts
- Nested tasks. If a nested task has a timestamp, it'll show up as a separate block, and will be excluded from its parent's unscheduled sub-items list

### Showing internet calendars

To show events from internet calendars like **Google Calendar, iCloud Calendar and Outlook** you only need to add an ICS link in the plugin settings.

#### Where to get a Google Calendar link

[Google Calendar instructions](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37648?hl=en#zippy=%2Csync-your-google-calendar-view-edit%2Cget-your-calendar-view-only)

#### Where to get an iCloud link

[iCloud Calendar instructions](https://www.souladvisor.com/help-centre/how-to-get-icloud-calendar-address-on-mac-in-ical-format)

#### Where to get an Outlook link

[Outlook Calendar instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/introduction-to-publishing-internet-calendars-a25e68d6-695a-41c6-a701-103d44ba151d?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)

Here's the relevant part:
> Under the settings in Outlook **on the web**, go to Calendar > Shared calendars. Choose the calendar you wish to publish and the level of details that you want others to see.

Here's how the settings look on the web version:

##### Alternative

If your organization doesn't let you share your calendar this way, you might try [a different way described in this issue](https://github.com/ivan-lednev/obsidian-day-planner/issues/395).

### Showing events from other files in your vault

1. Include its folder or tag into the Dataview filter
1. Add time and a date that Dataview recognizes: `‚è≥ 2021-08-29` or `[scheduled:: 2021-08-29]` or `(scheduled:: 2021-08-29)`.

Full examples:

```md
- [ ] 08:00 - 10:00 This task uses the shorthand format (used by obsidian-tasks) ‚è≥ 2021-08-29
- [ ] 11:00 - 13:00 This task uses the Dataview property format [scheduled:: 2021-08-29]
```

[obsidian-tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) adds a modal with some handy shortcuts for adding dates like these.

## What else you can do

- Observe your progress in the status bar
- Use the week view for multi-day planning
- Color tasks based on time
- Click on the timeline to create tasks
- Drag tasks to re-schedule
- Copy tasks by holding <code>Shift</code> while dragging (<strong>note: right now, only single line tasks are supported</strong>)
- Move multiple tasks by holding <code>Control</code> while dragging/resizing

## Commands

- Show the Day Planner Timeline
- Open today's Day Planner
- Show the Week Planner
- Insert Planner Heading at Cursor

## Note on the old plugin version

0.7.0 significantly changes what the plugin looks like and what it does. If you like to have some of the old behaviors back, [consider creating an issue](https://github.com/ivan-lednev/obsidian-day-planner/issues).

If for some reason you still want to use the old version, there are community forks, which you can use via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). [Here is one such fork](https://github.com/ebullient/obsidian-day-planner-og).
